phpLogin User Status Codes
---------------------------

This guide is provided for reference purposes only.  It is not used by any scripts.

This document applies to the "status" integer column in the db table "phplogin_users."


Codes:

-2:  Reserved.  Use this status to create user accounts that cannot be logged into.   This can be 
useful for linking to AI players in a game or reserving a username for later use.  Though this can 
also technically be used to create "unacceptable" usernames, it should not be used for that purpose.  
Instead, it is recommended that you add any such usernames to the array of invalid usernames in 
phplogin_check::valid_username() in check.phplogin.class.php.

-1:  Banned.  A user in this status is unable to login or authenticate.

0 :  Pending.  If a user has registered but not yet confirmed their email address (if applicable), 
this will be their status.  Users in Pending status are not able to login or authenticate.

1 :  Active.  This is the "standard" status for any normal user.

2 :  Moderator.  A Moderator user inherits all the privileges of Active status plus the ability to 
edit/ban users at or below Active status.  Moderators cannot create other moderators, nor can they 
actually delete a user account from the database.

3 :  Admin.  A user with this status inherits all the privileges of Moderator status plus 
administrator privileges.  An Admin can modify and delete users at or below Moderator status.  
An Admin can create Moderators but not Admins.  Admins cannot modify or delete other admins.

4 :  Superuser.  The superuser inherits all Admin privileges plus the ability to create, 
modify, and destroy other admins.  The first user registered is automatically set as 
the Superuser (see INSTALL file for details).  The superuser cannot create other 
superusers, nor can the superuser delete his account or remove his superuser status.  
It is possible to manually create another superuser, but NOT recommended!
